The Ghostery Private Browser has reached its end of life and will no longer receive security updates. It is strongly recommended to switch to a safe alternative like Firefox.

Current manifest is largely inspired by the one from
[Librewolf community](https://gitlab.com/librewolf-community/browser/flatpak/).

To upgrade the manifest to any new release, please use the script available in
the [Ghostery Private Browser Linux support][1] repository.

The current repository should be used to report any issue only related to the
**flatpak packaging** of the Ghostery Private Browser. If you want to report a
technical issue of the browser itself, please report it in [its own repository][2].
If your issue is about the usage of the browser, please report it
[with our dedicated support form][3].
